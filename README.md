# Angle-Between-Two-Vectors
Gives single command which finds the angle or solid angle between two vectors.

This program was made in TI-Basic on the TI-Nspire CX CAS II. It should work with a TI-Nspire CX CAS, and should not require the use of a Computer Algebra System, meaning TI-Nspire CX and CX II may also be able to use it.

The program creates one single command in which you input the X, Y, and Z (if needed) components of two different vectors and are then given the angle or solid angle that is created between the two vectors in some space.
